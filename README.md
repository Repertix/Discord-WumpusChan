# Wumpus Chan

#WARNING
<h6>Wumpus chan was originally developed in spanish. So almost all the code has Spanish language.<h6>

Wumpus is no more. ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

<h6>How to install?<h6>

Requirements 
* Install (`NodeJS`)[https://nodejs.org/es/download/]
* Install any code editor (Recommended: Visual Studio)

1. Install all the dependencies used in the code (If you want, you can just remove quick.db, that was just used for nothing, literally, lol).


<h6>Creating a Discord Bot App<h6>

* Go to (Discord Developer Portal)[https://discord.com/developers/applications]
* Press "New Application" and fill the required information (Just name.)
* Press "Add Bot"
* SUPER IMPORTANT! Your bot's token is the password that will make you control your bot, DON'T share your token with ppl, atleast you trust them or work with you

Replace token information in config.json to your bot's token!

<h6>Executing your bot</h6>

* Open cmd
* Type `cd:BOT CODE UBICATION` Example `C:\Users\Ninja\MyBot\`
* Type `node index.js`

And done! Your bot must be working! Good luck and enjoy your first bot!

I recommend to host it on Repl.It

If you use this for any purpose, keep the code open, pls!
